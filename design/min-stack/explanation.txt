Explanation:
- implementation basically the same as an ordinary stack, but also push the current minimum along with a value onto the stack


Notes:
- I decided to add an additonal dummy value at the beginning onto the stack, simply so that determining a minimum with an empty stack does not require additional code


Complexity analysis:
- Time: O(1) for all methods, since the current minimum is always available at the top of the stack, and all other stack operations are O(1)
- Space: O(n), same as an ordinary stack, but O(n) curent minimum values are also stored
