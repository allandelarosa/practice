Algorithm explanation:
- initialize min price to a large value
- iterate over array of prices, keeping track of min price
    - if a new min is found, update the min price
    - else, update max profit if current price - current min is larger


Complexity analysis:
(n is the length of given prices array)
- Time: O(n), performed in one pass
- Space: O(1), no additional data structures allocated, only minimum price and maximum price are stored
