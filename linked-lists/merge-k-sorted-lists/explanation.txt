Algorithm explanation:
- standard merge algorithm for two lists 
- merge lists one by one into the bigger merged list: 
    - start with empty list and merge first list into it 
    - merge second list into new merged list 
    - merge third list into merged second and first list 
    - etc


Complexity analysis:
- Time: O(n*m), where n is the length of the longest list and m is the number of the lists given; in the worst case, the first list is the longest and all of its elements are revisited each time another list is merged
- Space: O(n), the merge algorithm creates a new reference to the nodes in the lists being merged
